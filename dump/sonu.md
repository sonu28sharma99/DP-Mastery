First of congratulation on getting placed in **"A"** of F**A**ANG?

```
I think the hot topics for amazon interviews are
1. Tree
2. LinkedList
3. Graph
And Rest of the topics (like Arrays, Strings, hashmap, heap, etc)

```

I just want to know they ask **`dynamic programming`** in their technical interviews or not..????

I'm not asking about online assessment, I know they ask dp in their dynamic programming.


Thanks in advance:)
